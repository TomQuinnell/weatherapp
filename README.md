# weatherapp
A weather app to display the forecast and search for the forecasts in locations of the user's choice

I used OpenWeatherMapAPI (https://openweathermap.org/) for gathering live and future weather data, and WeatherAPI.com (https://www.weatherapi.com/) for their autocomplete API for search queries
I used the Swing library for building the GUI, and used the org.json library to parse JSON data from these APIs (manually downloaded and linked).
Note: I have the API keys stored at ./Resources/ApiKeys/{openweatherkey.txt, weatherapikey.txt}
Note: I have a bunch of Images stored at ./Resources/Imgs/
